For your prediction, you should train the following  models: • K-nn (based on Euclidian distance) • Logistic regression • Support Vector Classifier o Linear SVC o Polynomial SVC of degree m (m will be  set in the code) o Gaussian SVC.          • For the k-nn, evaluate the effect of k on the f1-score. For this evaluation, make 1,000  random train-test splits and provide the mean and STD f1-score for each k in the range 1  to 20 (included). Specify what value of K will be chosen and why • F1-score for the Logistic regression and Linear SVC models. For this evaluation, make  1,000 random train-test splits and provide the mean and STD f1-score (for each model). • For the polynomial SVC, evaluate the effect of the degree (m) on the f1-score. For this  evaluation, make 1,000 random train-test splits and provide the mean and STD f1-score  for each m in the range 2 to 5 (included). Specify what value of m will be chosen and  why • For the gaussian SVC, evaluate the effect of C on the f1-score. For this evaluation, make  1,000 random train-test splits and provide the mean and STD f1-score for each c in the  following set of values (0.2,0.5,1.2,1.8,3). Specify what value of C will be chosen and  why To make a fair analysis (and future comparison of the models), make sure to use the same 1,000  train-test splits to evaluate all models and their hyperparameters
